# Blender review inbox

The Blender chat appends one entry per delivery, newest at the top. The mc project chat (Minecraft threads) reads this
file, reviews each entry and builds from the hand-off it points to once J has picked.

Entry format:

```
## <date> pass <NNN>: <title>   [status: WAITING | PICKED | HANDED OFF | SENT]
- What: one or two lines on what was built and why (J's words in quotes).
- Open in Blender: C:\Users\Josh\Documents\LanternLive\<file>.blend (camera to start on)
- Review folder: docs/blender/review/<NNN>_<name>/ (README.md, contact sheet, poses JSON)
- For the game: docs/handoff/<folder>/ (only once J has picked)
- J's picks / open questions
```

## 2026-10-14 pass 228: ground flight with the running barrier   [HANDED OFF]
